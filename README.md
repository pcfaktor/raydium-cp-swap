# Fuzz Testing Report for Raydium Swap Program

## 1. Introduction

For the testing, the Raydium Swap program was chosen. Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain, which leverages a central limit order book to enable lightning-fast trades, shared liquidity, and new features for earning yield.

## 4. Observations

### Security Documentation
The program includes a security.txt file configured with information about the project, contact points for vulnerabilities, and links to the source code and audit reports. This demonstrates the project's commitment to security and transparency. The security.txt references an audit report by MadShield for Q1 2024, providing an additional layer of confidence in the programâ€™s security.

### Commented Code
The code is well-documented, with comments explaining the purpose of functions and parameters. However, there are a few minor typos in the comments (e.g., "tarde" instead of "trade", "vaule" instead of "value"). While these do not affect functionality, correcting these typos would enhance the code's professionalism and readability.

## 5. Conclusion

The fuzzing process did not reveal any bugs or crashes in the `raydium-cp-swap` program, indicating a high level of robustness in its implementation. The program has undergone a security audit and is part of an active bug bounty program on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/raydium), further demonstrating its commitment to maintaining a secure and reliable protocol.
Overall, the Raydium Swap program appears to be of high quality, with a strong security posture and diligent documentation practices.
